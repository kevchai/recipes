        <h1>Boody Cranberry Sauce</h1>

        <h3>Indulge in this boozy version of cranberry sauce at Christmas. The special ingredient is kirsch, though you could skip it and add extra cherry juice</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g light brown soft sugar</li>
            <li>50ml kirsch</li>
            <li>50ml cherry juice</li>
            <li>250g fresh or frozen cranberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Tip the sugar, kirsch and juice into a small pan over a medium-low heat and bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 mins until the sugar dissolves, then tip in the cranberries.</p></li>
            <li><p>Simmer for 5-10 mins until the cranberries have softened but are still holding their shape. Remove from the heat, spoon into a serving dish and leave to cool. Will keep chilled for a week or frozen for up to three months. Bring to room temperature before serving.</p></li>
        </ol>
