        <h1>Air-fryer Roasted Canned Potatoes</h1>

        <h3>Cook canned potatoes in an air fryer to make these alternative roasties. Though they're not the same as oven-cooked, they do turn golden and crisp</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>560g can peeled potatoes in water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Drain the potatoes in a colander, rinse and leave to drain again. Meanwhile, heat the air fryer for 2-3 mins at
                190C. Put the potatoes in a bowl and drizzle over the oil. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, plus any other seasonings you like (see tip, below).</p></li>
            <li><p>Mix well so the potatoes are fully coated in the oil and seasoning. Transfer to the air fryer basket and cook for 20-25 mins until golden and crisp.</p></li>
        </ol>
